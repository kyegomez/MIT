# Multimodal Instruction Tuning (MIT)

Welcome to Multimodal Instruction Tuning (MIT), an open-source project that brings together advanced visual processing and AI reasoning capabilities to interpret and understand multimedia data. This pipeline uses a mixture of detailed explanatory annotations and segmentation data from videos or images. We use GPT-4 for reasoning about the content of images or videos in context provided through segmentation.

## Principles

1. **Contextual Segmentation**: Using Segmentation-Anything, we extract object-level details from videos or images. This enriched visual data provides more detailed context for any subsequent reasoning task.

2. **Multimodal Reasoning**: We use GPT-4 to reason about the content of images or videos. The model is fed with text prompts generated from Lavar captions. This guided reasoning process increases the model's effectiveness in generating meaningful responses.

3. **Temporal Understanding**: The system infers changes over time by comparing the segmentation and reasoning of successive video frames. This temporal understanding is pivotal for tasks like video captioning or text-to-video synthesis.

## Approach

We believe in the potential of our system's effectiveness, which can be informally proven by examining each stage's contributions and their interactions. The segmentation stage effectively processes raw visual data, identifying essential elements that help the model understand the scene better. This processed data is then passed on to the reasoning stage, where GPT-4, guided by a text prompt, provides deep understanding. The model's reasoning can further improve through temporal inference between frames, understanding changes over time.

As long as each stage of the pipeline operates effectively and the data is appropriately managed, the overall system should function as intended and potentially reach State-of-the-Art performance.

## Getting Started

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement the MIT pipeline:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Collect a wide range of video or image datasets. The data should be diverse and relevant to the problem domain we aim to address.

2. **Segmentation**: Apply Segmentation-Anything to the collected data, producing a rich set of segmented and labeled images or videos.

3. **Text Prompt Generation**: Generate a Lavar caption for each segmented image or video to serve as a prompt for GPT-4.

4. **Multimodal Reasoning**: Feed each segmented image/video and its corresponding Lavar caption to GPT-4. The model will then reason about the image/video content.

5. **Temporal Inference**: If working with video datasets, compare successive frames to infer changes over time.

6. **Evaluation and Fine-tuning**: Evaluate the model's performance continually and fine-tune as required.

## Requirements

- A vast collection of video or image datasets.
- VisualNexus's Segmentation-Anything for image/video segmentation.
- Lavar Captions for generating text prompts.
- GPT-4 for multimodal reasoning.
- Adequate compute resources for model training and inference.
- Evaluation metrics to measure model performance and guide fine-tuning.
- A team of experts in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

## Potential Pipelines

1. **Video Summarization**: This pipeline could be used to generate summary captions for video clips, providing concise descriptions of events occurring in a video.

2. **Video Instruction Generation**: This pipeline can create detailed instructions based on video content. A use case might be to generate step-by-step instructions for a cooking video.

3. **Contextual Video Annotation**: Annotations that describe the context and provide additional information about the content can be generated by this pipeline. Useful in educational videos, documentaries, etc.

4. **Visual Q&A**: This pipeline can be utilized to create a visual question-answering system where the model responds to text-based queries about the visual content.

5

. **Video-to-Text**: This pipeline can transcribe visual content into textual form, making the content more accessible.

Remember, we encourage ideas, suggestions, and contributions from the open-source community. Let's build this together!
